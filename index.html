<p>About Me </p>

<p>I'm a 32 year old working mum based in Sydney, Australia. I have a 7 year old daughter and two furry purr machines to call my own. While I now certainly call Australia home, I was born and grew up on the tropical islands of Fiji. English is my first language but I also speak Fijian and Hindi. I enjoy bush walking, yoga and Pilates outside of work although I am an advocate of work-life integration. This means that I don&rsquo;t really believe in 9-to-5 work and try to enjoy work and play in balance with each other.</p>
